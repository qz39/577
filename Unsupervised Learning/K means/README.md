## K means  
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances.   

Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. As such, the techniques used are vastly different than those found in supervised learning. Unsupervised learning typically falls within the following two reahlms:  

1. Clustering  

2. Dimensionality Reduction
