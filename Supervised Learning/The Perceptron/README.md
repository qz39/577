## The Perceptron  
The perceptron is a single neuron model with the *sign* activation function  
We will implement and train this model on the palmer peguins dataset (which I have stored in a Datasets folder).
## Datasets  
The Palmer penguins dataset by Allison Horst, Alison Hill, and Kristen Gorman was first made publicly available as an R package. The goal of the Palmer Penguins dataset is to replace the highly overused Iris dataset for data exploration & visualization. Using this python package you can easily load the Palmer penguins into your python environment.
