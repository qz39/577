## k-Nearest Neighbors  
The $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm, or **KNN** for short, is a nonparametric algorithm that assumes that similar data exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.   
## Dataset  
The Palmer penguins dataset by Allison Horst, Alison Hill, and Kristen Gorman was first made publicly available as an R package. The goal of the Palmer Penguins dataset is to replace the highly overused Iris dataset for data exploration & visualization. Using this python package you can easily load the Palmer penguins into your python environment.
