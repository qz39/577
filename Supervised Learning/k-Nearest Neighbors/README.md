## k-Nearest Neighbors  
The $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm, or **KNN** for short, is a nonparametric algorithm that assumes that similar data exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.   
## Scikit-learn  
[**Scikit-learn**] is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection, model evaluation, and many other utilities. Key concepts and features include:  

* Algorithmic decision-making methods, including:  
    - Classification: identifying and categorizing data based on patterns.  
    - Regression: predicting or projecting data values based on the average mean of existing and planned data.  
    - Clustering: automatic grouping of similar data into datasets.  


* Algorithms that support predictive analysis ranging from simple linear regression to neural network pattern recognition.  


* Interoperability with NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib libraries.  

Whether you are just looking for an introduction to ML, want to get up and running fast, or are looking for the latest ML research tool, you will find that scikit-learn is both well-documented and easy to learn/use. As a high-level library, it lets you define a predictive data model in just a few lines of code, and then use that model to fit your data. Itâ€™s versatile and integrates well with other Python libraries, such as matplotlib for plotting, numpy for array vectorization, and pandas for dataframes.    

Though scikit-learn has deep learning capabilities, one will typically use **tensorflow** or **pytorch** when working with deep learning models. However, most any other model that you work with will be best implemented with scikit-learn.   
## Dataset  
The Palmer penguins dataset by Allison Horst, Alison Hill, and Kristen Gorman was first made publicly available as an R package. The goal of the Palmer Penguins dataset is to replace the highly overused Iris dataset for data exploration & visualization. Using this python package you can easily load the Palmer penguins into your python environment.
