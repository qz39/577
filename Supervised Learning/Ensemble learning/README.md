## Ensemble learning  
Ensemble methods are machine learning methods that aggregate the predictions of a group of base learners in order to form a single learning model. For example, imagine that each person in this video is a trained machine learning model and notice the average of their predictions is a much more accurate prediction that the individual predictions. In this lecture we will consider two types of ensemble concepts and methods. Namely,  

- Bagging

- Random Forests  

## Datasets
- The Palmer penguins dataset by Allison Horst, Alison Hill, and Kristen Gorman.  
The goal of the Palmer Penguins dataset is to replace the highly overused Iris dataset for data exploration & visualization. Using this python package you can easily load the Palmer penguins into your python environment.
