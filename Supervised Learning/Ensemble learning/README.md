## Ensemble learning  
Ensemble methods are machine learning methods that aggregate the predictions of a group of base learners in order to form a single learning model. For example, imagine that each person in this video is a trained machine learning model and notice the average of their predictions is a much more accurate prediction that the individual predictions. In this lecture we will consider two types of ensemble concepts and methods. Namely,  

- Bagging

- Random Forests
