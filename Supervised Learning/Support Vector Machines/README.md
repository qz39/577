# Support Vector Machines  
A Support Vector Machine was first introduced in the 1960s and later improvised in the 1990s. It is a supervised learning machine learning classification algorithm that has become extremely popular nowadays owing to its extremely efficient results.  

An SVM is implemented in a slightly different way than other machine learning algorithms. It is capable of performing classification, regression and outlier detection.  

Support Vector Machine is a discriminative classifier that is formally designed by a separative hyperplane. It is a representation of examples as points in space that are mapped so that the points of different categories are separated by a gap as wide as possible. In addition to this, an SVM can also perform non-linear classification. Let us take a look at how the Support Vector Machine work.

### Advantages of SVM  
- Effective in high dimensional spaces  

- Still effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples  

- Uses a subset of training points in the decision function that makes it memory efficient  

- Different kernel functions can be specified for the decision function that also makes it versatile   

### Disadvantages of SVM  

- If the number of features is much larger than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.  

- SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using five-fold cross-validation.
