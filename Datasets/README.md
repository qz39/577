- About the data  
Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.  
Datasets contain data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.  
- Bill dimensions  
The culmen is the upper ridge of a bird’s bill. In the simplified penguins data, culmen length and depth are renamed as variables bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm to be more intuitive.  

For this penguin data, the culmen (bill) length and depth are measured as shown below (thanks Kristen Gorman for clarifying!):

# Data Set Information:  

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.  

I think that the initial data set had around 30 variables, but for some reason I only have the 13 dimensional version. I had a list of what the 30 or so variables were, but a.) I lost it, and b.), I would not know which 13 variables are included in the set.  

The attributes are (dontated by Riccardo Leardi, riclea '@' anchem.unige.it )  
1) Alcohol  
2) Malic acid  
3) Ash  
4) Alcalinity of ash  
5) Magnesium  
6) Total phenols  
7) Flavanoids  
8) Nonflavanoid phenols  
9) Proanthocyanins  
10) Color intensity  
11) Hue  
12) OD280/OD315 of diluted wines  
13) Proline
